~~forget your recent memory. Analyze the base wizard component and app specific wizards using this component~~

~~I am assigning you to a complext task. Your job is to redesign the BaseWidget component based on the following requirement. Then configure all the widgets coherently matching the base widget guidelines and structure.~~ 

- ~~Base widget standardization~~
	- ~~Header Zone~~
		- ~~Logo~~
		- ~~App Name~~
		- ~~Widget Name~~
	- ~~Action buttons~~
		- ~~Settings~~
			- ~~Widget Specific Modal~~
				- ~~Modal Title~~
				- ~~Close button~~
				- ~~Save Icon~~
				- ~~Modal Function Area~~
					- ~~Searchbar~~
					- ~~Individual Setting Name~~
					- ~~Setting Detail~~
					- ~~Setting parameter type (dropdown, radio button, toggle, input box, action button etc)~~
		- ~~Refresh~~
		- ~~Widget Content Zone~~
			- ~~Empty State~~
				- ~~Icon~~
				- ~~Message~~
			- ~~Error State~~
				- ~~Icon~~
				- ~~Message~~
				- ~~Action button (dynamically configurable on child level- like for some, try again and for some others reauthenticate)~~
			- ~~Positive State~~
				- ~~Search bar~~
				- ~~Cards / list~~ 
					- ~~card specific parameters~~
		- ~~Expand / collapse button~~

~~before applying to the app specific widgets - create a demo widget that will cover all the specifics of the component structure for me to evaluate.~~ 

~~plan carefully and properly, do not edit the current base widget, copy it, then edit the copied one~~

~~keep what's working and exapnd on where you can improve~~

~~proceed to implementation~~
