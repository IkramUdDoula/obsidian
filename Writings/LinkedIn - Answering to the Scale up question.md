"So, Are we ready for 1,000,000 users?"

If you are a product manager, chances are you have heard a version of this question where stakeholders are curious if the system is well equipped to handle a massive user base.  

Let's concentrate on some of my personal observations on how to approach this question so that you can find the answer on your own.  

1. Handling a million users is not primarily a technical concern, but is a business concern. It’s highly unlikely that a business will suddenly see that level of traffic overnight. Here’s a small tip. If you ever find yourself asked about handling that kind of scale, go to the person leading day to day operations and ask them if they’re prepared. If it is not their headache at the moment, you don’t need to worry about it either. The point is simple. Scale follows business growth, not the other way around. Planning for theoretical extremes before the business is ready is often unnecessary and wasteful.

2. Most of the non-technical stakeholders you interact with think of scaling up as **enlargement**, not **extension**. Let me give you an example. Imagine you’re trying to store some rainwater since it’s been raining cats and dogs for a few days. You can either buy a **giant water tank**, or you can buy **10 small ones** and keep adding new buckets as they fill up. Now buying a giant tank may seem practical because you want to save as much water as you can, but it’s not always realistic because the rain might stop the moment you set up the tank, and you’ll end up with a huge, underused investment. On the other hand, if you keep extending your army of small buckets, you’ll have a more flexible and optimized system that grows with the rain instead of guessing how long it’ll last. Of course, managing a lot of small buckets isn’t free of challenges. You’ll need to monitor them, make sure none overflow, and spend more time organizing them. But this trade-off brings resilience and adaptability.

3. There are times, however, when you do need to be ready for a sudden jump in traffic. These cases are well documented, studied, and solved. The idea is that  preparation should be guided by business signals, not hypothetical fears. Your business should meet certain criteria before worrying about traffic surges.
	- Is the product targeted to the B2C segment?
	- Does the company practice product-led growth?
	- Have competitors ever experienced a similar influx?
	- Do you see people lining up in front of your office to use your product?
	- Is there significant media coverage or press attention expected?
	- Has a similar product gone viral on social or digital platforms before?
	- Can giants like OpenAI, Meta or Google launch a feature to thanos-snap your business overnight?
	If you have answered yes to all of those questions except for the last one, you better start sending emails to Amazon or Microsoft. Otherwise, relax and focus on how you are going to create more values for the users.

4. Every technical decision must align with business goals. For example, if the company aims to acquire 20% more customers in the next quarter and that’s the primary business objective, then every line of code, PRD, Jira ticket, and even email should contribute toward that target. Otherwise, you risk wasting time and resources.
5. Of course, some tasks may not directly impact that specific goal, such as managing technical debt, handling security, or optimizing performance. However, these efforts still support the broader objective by ensuring the **sustainability and long-term health of the business**.
