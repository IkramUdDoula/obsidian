“So, are we ready for 1,000,000 users?”

If you are a product manager, chances are you have heard some version of this question. Stakeholders are curious, often anxious, about whether the system can handle a massive user base. It’s a reasonable concern, but one that requires careful perspective. 

Over the years, working with diverse stakeholders, customers, and supervisors, I’ve picked up some insights that can help you approach this question and find the answer on your own.

First, handling a million users is not primarily a technical concern—it’s a business concern. It’s extremely unlikely that a business will suddenly see that level of traffic overnight. Here’s a small tip: if you are ever asked about scaling to this magnitude, go talk to the person leading day-to-day operations. Ask them if they are prepared. If it isn’t their immediate concern, it shouldn’t be yours either. The principle is simple: scale follows business growth, not the other way around. Planning for theoretical extremes before the business is ready is often unnecessary.

Second, most non-technical stakeholders think of scaling up as **enlargement**, not **extension**. Let me explain with an analogy. Imagine it has been raining heavily for days, and you want to store as much rainwater as possible. You have two choices: buy a **giant water tank**, or buy **10 small buckets** and keep adding more as they fill up. At first glance, the giant tank seems practical—you can capture as much water as possible. But what if the rain stops the moment you install it? That massive investment could sit mostly unused. In contrast, if you keep extending your collection of small buckets, you create a flexible system that grows with the rain. Sure, managing many buckets comes with its own challenges—you need to monitor them, prevent overflow, and spend time organizing them—but the trade-off brings resilience and adaptability.

Third, there are moments when you do need to be ready for a sudden surge in traffic. These cases are well documented and often studied. The preparation should be guided by **business signals**, not hypothetical fears. Before worrying about a traffic spike, ask yourself:

- Is the product targeted to the B2C segment?
    
- Does the company practice product-led growth?
    
- Have competitors ever experienced a similar influx?
    
- Do you see people lining up in front of your office to use the product?
    
- Is there significant media coverage or press attention expected?
    
- Has a similar product gone viral on social or digital platforms?
    
- Could giants like OpenAI, Meta, or Google launch a feature that instantly disrupts your market?
    

If you answer yes to all of these questions except the last one, then maybe it’s time to start sending emails to Amazon or Microsoft. Otherwise, relax. Focus on creating more value for your users.

Fourth, every technical decision must align with business goals. For instance, if the company’s sole objective is to acquire 20% more customers in the next quarter, then every line of code, PRD, Jira ticket, and even every email should contribute toward that target. Anything else risks wasting time and resources. Of course, some tasks—managing technical debt, ensuring security, or optimizing performance—may not directly impact that specific goal, but they still support the broader objective by safeguarding the business’s long-term sustainability. If you are asked to prepare for scale-up readiness, always ask yourself which business goal it serves.

Fifth, product managers are shared resources, balancing priorities between the company and the customer. Advocating for the users is one of the key qualities that differentiates a product manager from a backlog manager. Whenever you are asked to build a feature, ask two questions: what does this do for the business, and what does it do for the customer? The effort and money required to build a system robust enough to handle a million users can backfire if the user experience is neglected. Take Skype as an example. It was technically ready to handle three pandemics. Today, if you Google "Skype," you will see ads for Microsoft Teams. How ironic.

These are the lessons I’ve learned from working with diverse stakeholders, customers, and supervisors. I’m not here to tell you exactly how to manage your products—that’s not something I do for free—but the key takeaway is to **gather enough justification before you spend time diving into AWS pricing pages**. And let me warn you, there’s no AWS pricing page, figuratively speaking.

So, when asked the question, “Are we ready for a million users?” my answer is simple: **Yes, I am ready. Are you?**
